What happened to the industry to take the US from undisputed global shipbuilding powerhouse to being irrelevant?\n\nFurthermore, shipbuilding is different from other components of US de-industrialization which are more easily explained. Shipbuilding is capital intensive, highly skilled work, it's high on the manufacturing value chain, it could rely on a steady stream of government contracts, it couldn't be easily moved either to union-unfriendly states or overseas, and workers have long been unionized even in \"business friendly\" states. The industry is very viable even in high wage countries, with two of the three global leaders being Japan and South Korea\n\nSo, what happened?",

    "text": "**I am not The OOP, OOP is u/throwra-19237**\n\n**My husband's [28m] car got destroyed and now he's taking his frustrations out on me [24f]**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** &gt;!Domestic abuse, physical assault!&lt;\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/1agCkjq5W1)  **Dec 19, 2020**\n\nWe've been dating for 4 years, married for 11 months.\n\nBasically, a truck driver hit my husband's car and entirely destroyed it. It was a hit-and-run, so no one knows who the driver of the truck was which is ironic because almost all of our neighbours saw it happening but nobody bothered to write down the license plate number. The accident happened at around 7 am. Our whole neighbourhood started talking about it and three hours later one of them ***finally*** decided to let us know what happened. Needless to say, it was a shitty way to start the day.\n\nMy husband loves his cars, especially this one. We're currently trying to figure things out with our insurance, but it's not looking good. My husband is super frustrated and angry, understandably so. Unfortunately, he's taking all of this frustration and anger out on me. He's yelling at me nonstop and forcefully pushes me out of the way when I'm standing in his way. I tried to comfort him and gently touched his arm but he slapped my hand away.\n\nI've never seen him like that and honestly, it's scaring me. I'm one of those people that immediately get emotional when someone raises their voice at them. Is there anything that I can do? How can I calm him down?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: My husband's car got destroyed in a hit-and-run and now he's taking his frustrations out on me.\n\n**TOP COMMENTS**\n\n**elleinadgem**\n\n&gt;Leave and let him work out this tantrum on his own. Come back only when he agrees to treat you with respect. He HIT you. He PUSHED you. That is physical abuse. It is NOT okay. You do not have to stay and be his emotional punching bag until he feels like stopping. In a few days when he has calmed down, tell him in no uncertain terms that you will not tolerate that kind of treatment and if it happens again, even once, you're gone. Personally, I wouldn't agree to return until he agrees to go to therapy\n\n**~**\n\n**Diamond-TTB**\n\n&gt;\"He's yelling at me nonstop and forcefully pushes me out of the way when I'm standing in his way. I tried to comfort him and gently touched his arm but he slapped my hand away.\"\n\n&gt;It's time to pack a bag and go visit someone for a bit. If he is angry, you are not his emotional or physical punching bag. This is not normal, and you should not have to deal, endure or cope with it. It's a car, it can be replaced. He is placing the value of his car over you. That is not ok. Big red flag.\n\n**~**\n\n**V3r1ty**\n\n&gt;Leave him be for now. When things are calmed down you bring up his unacceptable behavior to him. Insist and don\u2019t back down, this is therapy worthy behavior. He needs to learn to deal with his emotions like an adult, because right now you are living with a teenager lashing out.\n\n&gt;Let me guess. He is a stoic guy who carries his emotions on the inside and never discusses or allows himself to express emotions, making sure they are sealed away. And when he finally gets emotional, the floodgates open and all hell is loose. Typical manly behavior. I am saying this as a man in my thirties who had to learn the same, be in healthy contact with my emotions.\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Thanks for the advice!\n\n&gt;&gt;Yes, you're actually spot on.\n\n[Update - rareddit](https://www.rareddit.com/r/relationships/comments/kuk34o/update_my_husbands_28m_car_got_destroyed_and_now/)  **Jan 10, 2021 (22 days later)**\n\nJust wanted to let y'all know that my dear husband will soon be my ex-husband.\n\nMost people suggested to leave for a short while to let my husband deal with his emotions on his own and to avoid me being his punching bag. I spent a full week at my mom's house and when I came back he was still mad about his car. It got to the point where he was transferring all of his anger on to me, so now there were two angry people instead of one. We kept getting into fights and discussions, but I decided that this marriage wasn't worth saving anymore when he pushed me out of his way (I wasn't purposefully standing in his way. I was preparing a meal in the kitchen) so hard that I lost my footing and hit my head against the corner of our kitchen table. I must've lost conciousness for a short amount of time because suddenly my husband was next to me and was apologizing.\n\nI'm going to be honest. It is breaking my heart to leave this man but I'm genuinely scared for my safety when I'm around him. There's plenty of fish in the sea I guess...\n\u200b\nTL;DR: I'm getting a divorce.\n\n**FINAL COMMENTS**\n\n**Trustme_ima_doctor12**\n\n&gt;Did you contact the police? This assault should be reported. I hope you are ok. I\u2019m glad you have your parents near by for support\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;I did not, but it might really be a good idea to contact them.\n\n**MysticYoYo**\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Please do Op. You really do need to file a report and document that. Hopefully you\u2019ll never need it but if you do, you\u2019ll have it on record.\n\n**~**\n\n**cittacitta**\n\n&gt;I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting out. Has he really never shown you this side of him before?\n\n**OOP**\n\n&gt;&gt;Now that I'm looking back at it, he has always been a person with a lot of anger inside of him. Peace was never an option, but violence was. However, that violence has never been directed at me until the incident with his car happened.\n\n&gt;&gt;To be honest, I guess I never really wanted to see and accept that side of him so I just ignored it because I was so in love with him.\n\n**~**\n\n**Pinkleton**\n\n&gt;I'm so sorry. A head injury where you blacked out is no joke. I hope you got checked out by a doctor. Your husband literally could have killed you.\n\n**TEG_SAR**\n\n&gt;&gt;He almost Million Dollar Baby\u2019d her.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**",

    "text": "Dear Kenny,\n\nRe; Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!\n\nOk, first up\u2026 I obviously don\u2019t speak for the entire community and I have no idea what everyone including the mods will think of this, but whatever, I\u2019m laying down a gauntlet, throwing out a challenge, drawing a line in the sand [insert other worn out metaphor]\u2026 \n\nKENNETH GRIFFIN, COME HERE TO SUPERSTONK AND ENGAGE IN AN \u2018ASK ME ANYTHING\u2019 EVENT.\n\nYou see Ken, you keep claiming you represent retail, and I for one have my doubts. I have questions, such as;\n\nHow can you own a hedge fund and a market making business? Is that not a massive conflict of interest?\n\nWhy did you lie to Congress?\n\nDid you really puke in front of congress?\n\nHow did you manage to be in possession of a ton of Puts right before the buy button was removed on that fateful day?\n\nWhat is your real relationship with mayonnaise?\n\nWhy do you think buying \u2018meme\u2019 stocks puts pension funds at risk? Are you not responsible if thats the case?\n\nHow much do you pay your shills? \n\nHas Vlad finally been able to reach you? Or have you blocked his number?\n\nJust how much are you underwater financially?\n\nWas it really necessary to buy a copy of the constitution? Shouldn\u2019t you be more responsible?\n\nIf you represent retail, why can\u2019t we see your books?\n\nIf you represent retail, why is your PFOF system screwing us over?\n\nIf you represent retail, why do you prevent genuine price discovery?\n\nIf you represent retail, why use dark pools and use other methods to avoid lit exchanges?\n\nWas that you that has a hissy fit on Twitter, or one of your underlings?\n\nWhere do your private jets keep going? \n\nWhy do you hate cats?\n\nNow, I\u2019m just an idiot without any money, so obviously I\u2019m completely unimportant and I know you could answer ALL of these questions fully and to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, but I am confident this community could present some questions that will challenge you intellectually. Think you can handle it Ken? Or do you think some people here could outsmart you?\n\nSo again, drop the lawyers, drop the facade, sack up, and come talk to the people you claim to represent.\n\nI double dog dare you. No backsies.\n\nIf it makes you feel better, I promise I won\u2019t ask about the Lolita Express and related matters. (I do not speak for everyone however).\n\nNow I\u2019m flexible, so you can choose the date and time. I just need a picture of you on Twitter with a shoe on your head, for validation reasons. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t beneath your dignity. \n\nI patiently await your response.\n\nRegards,\n\nSLODt.\n\nP.S.\n\nI\u2019ll sweeten the deal by drawing your chosen username too. \n\nP.P.S.\n\nIf I get reported to admin, I\u2019ll know it was you Ken.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "We live in Asia. My retired mom found this introducing broker/financial advisor who basically fast talked her into putting a substantial chunk of life savings into first into incredibly risky investments including, unbelievably, a memecoin that was briefly listed and almost immediately flatlined. A chunk of her life savings has evaporated (15,000 USD worth) in like 50 days. \n\nI was chalking some stuff to incompetence and/or the worst luck, but there is some suspicious stuff \u2014 like refusing to leave a paper trail to any advice he was giving her, getting her to make fake declarations that that include claiming she has been trading for a few years? The memecoin shit is the last straw. Neither of us know much about trading (clearly) but no advisor in their right mind could have thought there was any shot at making\nbank at this unknown memecoin. \n\nMy country does not have laws protecting the elderly from financial frauds. We don't have much written proof, so it feels like legal doors are definitely shut. All I have are his phone number and email ID. And I know he's trying to brand himself as a trading content creator on LinkedIn and YouTube. \n\nI want to make his life difficult. What do I do? ",

    "text": "If you are familiar with the show \"Love is Blind\" this concept is similar but 100% internet based. From a browser you will login to a zoom style video call that is being recorded between you and your potential match. We the audience get to see both sides audio and video. But you \"in the pod\" will only hear audio. Your camera needs to be on though, and you should be camera ready because that's the whole point of the show. You should have a nice quiet place to broadcast from (your own apartment, house, office). A good microphone is required. The background needs to be real so make your bed or clean up your kitchen. Whatever the camera sees our audience will see.\n\nWe are not associated with the show \"Love is Blind\" in any way. We are calling this version \"Love at First Mic\" ask me anything.\n\nProof: https://imgur.com/a/uCaJ1pv",
