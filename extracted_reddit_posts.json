    "text": "I am not OP. That isu/ThrowRA-chroniclywho posted tor/relationship_adviceTW:infidelity, weaponized incompetence, gaslightingOriginal PostJune 14th, 2025My husband I have been together for 8 years, the last 3 we\u2019ve been married. Little things keep adding up and I don\u2019t even know how to approach these issues. He wants kids soon but I can\u2019t trust that he\u2019d support me. I\u2019m trying to figure out if I try to work on us or just leave.Recently as in the last 4 years, I have been dealing with chronic health issues but just this year alone I\u2019ve had 3 surgeries to fix various things for my health. Our sex life hasn\u2019t been good in a few years since I got ill. Maybe once or twice a month, he has told me that it\u2019s not enough and he\u2019s feeling rejected and is making his mental health worse but if we have kids we won\u2019t be able to have sex while I\u2019m recovering?I work 5-6 days a week 12 hour night shifts in healthcare. I am the primary breadwinner in our relationship, he bounces from job to job and recently was unemployed for over a year while he was claiming to be applying to jobs. I know the job market is horrible right now so I wasn\u2019t pushing. I found out he was lying, he hadn\u2019t applied for anything in about 6 months including the jobs I got him recommended for through some connections I have. We got into a massive fight and I basically told him if he didn\u2019t have a job at the end of the month I was leaving and he could figure out bills himself. Not even a week later he was back working at his old job.I still do all the cooking, cleaning, and household upkeep. On my days off I spend 3-4 hours just putting everything in order for the week. Even when he wasn\u2019t working he wasn\u2019t doing anything except playing video games in another room while I slept, so when I\u2019d wake up there would be laundry I\u2019d have to switch or cat litter I\u2019d have to scoop.He wants kids soon, but with my chronic health problems it\u2019s going to make children a really hard process on my body, lots of health risks and I would basically have to be on bed rest the whole time and in and out of doctor appointments. I couldn\u2019t work or do anything really and I\u2019m just scared I won\u2019t get the support that I need. I don\u2019t even know if I want to have kids with him anymore.He gets money every month from a settlement and he says it\u2019s enough to make up for the income I won\u2019t be bringing in if I get pregnant. The settlement payout every month is less than  1/4 of what I make in 2 weeks.I feel like I\u2019m his mother already, I feel like I\u2019d be one of those married single mothers\u2026.I\u2019ve asked him about therapy, individual or couples and he is dismissive. Saying therapy hasn\u2019t helped in the past. So I\u2019ve asked about medications but he doesn\u2019t want to take a pill everyday.I don\u2019t want to come across as horrible or manipulative but I\u2019m about ready to write out everything I do, bill payments, chores, time I\u2019m at work, etc. and have him do it all for a month then tell me he thinks we can have kids right now.Edit (6/14 @2300):A few things since this is a real story and not AI. And I am a real person who is making choices in order to keep up with the current economy and situation-1)I work the hours I do so I can build up my PTO and sick time for my procedures and recovery time. Yes I have FMLA for these but it only pays out 60% of my wage vs 100% if I use PTO. Overtime accrues PTOx2 and pays time and a half, we also have a pick up bonus of $10 an hour. I have been working at this hospital since 2015 as a CNA and phlebotomist since 2018 and an RN since 2020 so I have seniority and that comes benefits, Yay unions!2)I work night shift because it has the flexibility for my schedule and they work with me for my restrictions. I am lucky enough to work in a hospital that uses lifts and is staffed as well as can be currently. Shift differential also gives me an additional $6 an hour and that quickly adds up.3) My surgeries were laparoscopic, and recovery time is about 1-4 weeks on average. Surgery 1 and 3 were both exploratory. My second was to remove a lesion on my intestines that connected them to my abdominal wall as well as a cyst on my ovary, and recovery was 4 weeks with 4 more on restrictions. I am about to have a 4th surgery to remove my gallbladder, recovery is 1-2 weeks with 2 weeks of recovery. Yes I have had a lot of surgeries this year but I haven\u2019t had any before this unless you count upper and lower GI scopes, pelvic floor testing, gastric emptying test, X-rays, CTs, an MRI, labs, genetic testing, and HIDA scans. Or maybe the diet changes and medications that you have to be on for months at a time before you\u2019d see any really changes. I also have the birth control implant and me coming off of that would involve about 3 different doctors\u2019 inputs and oversight.4) I blocked all of my husbands accounts and his friends accounts that I know of. I plan on deleting this at some point, but I\u2019ve just gotten angrier with each comment and everything I type out. At this point I don\u2019t care if he finds this. Maybe it would be a wake up call he needs.5)Our wedding was supposed to take place in November of 2020. That obviously didn\u2019t happen. We rescheduled to the end of 2021 so we didn\u2019t loose deposits. He quit his job about 2 months after our wedding.6)People do things like meal prep for a week and find relaxation in cooking. My hospital provides scrubs. When I am home I have more than 6 pairs of underwear. So it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have clothes if I don\u2019t do laundry every day.I appreciate all the comments but to the rude ones especially please remember that I am a real person. I\u2019m sorry I have to justify every small detail of my health problems for you. Unfortunately the knee brace girl in middle school sometimes grows up and still has health problems. :)This is my first time being alive and not everything is going to be perfect. I am trying my best and sometimes people do stupid things because they love someone.UpdateJuly 16th, 2025Hello again Reddit, my previous post is on my page. I tried to link it but the pain medication might be impairing me.I had my surgery a few days ago and since I have time off I figured I\u2019d write an update for anyone curious. It will be long and I apologize.TLDR: I tried to have one more discussion with him before I threw in the towel. He asked for an open marriage and I told him to move out. Papers are being filed and I have lawyer.I talked with my lawyer last week and the hope is papers are to be drafted and he will be formally served when he comes back from his work trip in 2 weeks.On one of my days off I wanted to have a discussion about our relationship and it didn\u2019t go well. I had spent the night cleaning and getting the house put together because my anxiety was so bad. When he woke up in the morning I had breakfast made and we made just made polite small talk.I started the conversation by asking him if he was happy in our relationship, I\u2019ll summarize the conversation:Me: are you happy like this? With us? I feel like we are roommates more than a married couple..Him: I don\u2019t think either of us have been happy for a while\u2026 I do still love you and what to raise children with you, you\u2019ll be a great mom\u2026 I have been meaning to talk to you about somethingMe: \u2026okay\u2026Him: do you remember my friends in (city)? And how they were having problems in their relationship after (fake name) came out as ace? How they opened their relationship so (fake name) could still get his\u2026 needs\u2026 met. (At this point I was just staring at him, he kept rambling on) I\u2019ve joined some groups online, they said it saved their marriage. And with how much I\u2019m traveling now for work. It would be every other 2 weeks, you know. And I\u2019m in (city name) so it\u2019s not like it would be someone you know or would ever meet\u2026Me: what the fuck?Him: I mean think about it, we could have a surrogate this way. I know it would be a lot but we could make it work. You\u2019ve always talked about fostering or adopting and it would be just like that.Me: did you get someone pregnant? Is this your way of telling me you cheat on me when you travel for work?Him: no no no, god no, there was one girl at the bar who was flirting with me and it just felt nice to be wanted like that.He then pulled out his phone and started showing me \u201csupport\u201d groups he had joined online for poly people in monogamous relationships. There was probably 3 or 4 of them that he had been texting in for the last few weeks trying to gain the confidence to talk to me about opening up our relationship. He brought up how he knows I\u2019ve been thinking about switching to travel contracts and I can meet people there but then we come back home we\u2019re together and married because we still love each other.I have nothing against people who are in poly relationships, we have friends who are and have met their partners and go out all together. It\u2019s just not for me, when I\u2019m with someone I want to be the only person they\u2019re with. I don\u2019t want to get tested regularly, I don\u2019t want to risk surprise pregnancy, I don\u2019t want to feel jealous or wonder if he\u2019s texting another girl while he\u2019s supposed to be spending time with me.I let him finish his speech before I told him it hasn\u2019t felt like we\u2019ve been married in a long time and I\u2019m done. Hearing that he wants to see other people killed any last feelings I may have had. I\u2019m not in love anymore and staying together isn\u2019t going to make either of us happy. We both want kids but our timelines are different, what we want from the future is different now. I asked him to move out and he didn\u2019t seem surprised. I walked away and left him in the kitchen before I drove to my friend\u2019s house since I just couldn\u2019t be there. We spent the day drinking and eating ice cream while I went from crying to laughing to screaming.She is currently going through a divorce over her ex husbands porn addiction and the debt he put them in because of it. She gave me her lawyers information and I had an appointment set up with him a few days later.I went home the next day and he had moved most of his stuff out, his side of the closet is empty, his cat, the stuff in the bathroom, a few of our wedding pictures have been taken off the wall and I can\u2019t find them so I think he took them, and his gaming set up.The house feels incredibly empty now. He travels for work so I\u2019m used to being in the house alone but now my toothbrush is lonely in the cup on the sink. Our garage feels bigger now, the bed get cold, I only have to cook for one now. I miss his presence, I miss having someone to come home too, and I won\u2019t lie I\u2019ve spent the last week crying and my heart hurts.We didn\u2019t speak for a few days after he left, his mom reached out before he did. She wanted to see how I was doing and if there was anything she could do for me. We had a great relationship and I\u2019m honestly going to miss having her in my life. We have a lot of the same dietary restrictions but for different reasons, and she was my food adventure buddy. We would go out for a coffee or lunch to some of the few restaurants and cafes that we can safely eat at. She invited me out for coffee and I went. When we met up the next day we made small talk until the divorce came up.She let me know how he was doing, he moved into one of the houses on their property, they have like 60 acres and 4 houses on the property that different family members live in. He hasn\u2019t really gotten out of bed, she\u2019s worried about him and wanted us to talk it out. She asked if I was willing to go to couples counseling and told her I\u2019ve been asking for that for about a year and his response was no. I was drowning and he didn\u2019t want to help fix it but now that I\u2019ve decided to leave is when he wants to work it and I just can\u2019t. She stayed silent for a while before asking me if I still loved him, I do but I don\u2019t. I told her I loved who he was but I\u2019m too full of hurt that I don\u2019t feel the love anymore. I can\u2019t keep taking care of him like he\u2019s my child, I can\u2019t keep bank rolling our lives alone, I need a partner who is able to support me and I haven\u2019t felt supported by her son in a long time. We were both crying by the end of our talk and she gave a really big hug before leaving.He wanted to talk the next day and he came back to the house to talk. When he came in it was awkward, he wanted to give me a hug when he and I did, he went for a kiss and I turned my head so he kissed my cheek. We talked for a while about our relationship and how it got to this point. He apologized for a lot, he went into specifics of how he never helped around the house, he could\u2019ve done more since he was home. It wasn\u2019t fair to me that he put it all on me. He told me he\u2019s looking at a new job, one where he doesn\u2019t have to travel and it\u2019s actually in the field he got his degree in. He gave me an update on his cat, who is struggling to the adjustment of the new house. I told him I\u2019ll have papers for him in a few weeks and he couldn\u2019t look me in the eyes for the rest of the time he was there. I helped him pack some of the odds and ends that he left around the house and he left again.At the appointment with the lawyer we talked about what it would look like for the divorce process. Unless he wants the house I plan to buy his half. If I do that then there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t have to pay alimony unless he fights for it. He has the potential to make more than me so my lawyer doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to pay anyways. We don\u2019t have children, unless you count fur babies, and I took a pregnancy test recently to confirm that I\u2019m not pregnant so that won\u2019t be a factor. We each own our cars and pay for them ourselves. We have a joint savings but I can prove I\u2019ve been the only one contributing for the last 2 years so it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll get most of that. I\u2019m not touching it besides for the bills for the house per my lawyers advice. I will hopefully have papers for my soon to be ex to fill out and if he gets a lawyer to look over.My 2 cats have been laying in bed with me and haven\u2019t left my side since he left. They\u2019re trying to make me feel better but it\u2019s hard. My friend who is also getting a divorce has said that we\u2019ll have a hot girl summer together and it makes me laugh but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready or even close to it. I don\u2019t want to meet new people I don\u2019t want to do first dates again. I think I\u2019m just going to single for a while.My mom sent me me this poem after I told them about the divorce and it makes me cry reading it, I\u2019ve learned a lot from this relationship and I\u2019m content being the old crazy cat lady for the foreseeable future.\u201cI will never love the same after you. I was always the girl that loved so hard that it hurt, until it hurt. I watched you change everyday until you eventually become someone I told myself I would never settle for. But how do I leave you? I told myself it was just a rough patch and we can work through this. I will do more to make you love me again. Because I don\u2019t give up on people. So why would I do that to you? I will put myself through hell for you, I will hate myself to love you, and I will rip myself apart so that you feel cared for. Because I was serious when I said I would die for you, because I almost did\u2026 I guess I ripped myself apart so much that I had nothing left. I cared so much about you that I stopped caring about myself completely. I lost who I was and I was no longer strong. And I watched myself change everyday until I eventually became someone I told myself I\u2019d never be. But it\u2019s my fault for not having a limit on how much I\u2019m willing to give, And for how long I\u2019m willing to stay. And for loving you more than I loved me. Because I loved you so hard that it hurt\u2026 So I will never love the same after you\u201d-\u201cI will never love the same after you\u201d  by Allie HardingThanks Reddit for support and validating my feelings, I don\u2019t know yet if I\u2019m going to delete this or not. But I don\u2019t think I will update this or ever long into this account again. I hope everyone stays happy and healthy :) take care.I am not the original poster.

I have questions, such as;How can you own a hedge fund and a market making business? Is that not a massive conflict of interest?Why did you lie to Congress?Did you really puke in front of congress?How did you manage to be in possession of a ton of Puts right before the buy button was removed on that fateful day?What is your real relationship with mayonnaise?Why do you think buying \u2018meme\u2019 stocks puts pension funds at risk? Are you not responsible if thats the case?How much do you pay your shills?Has Vlad finally been able to reach you? Or have you blocked his number?Just how much are you underwater financially?Was it really necessary to buy a copy of the constitution? Shouldn\u2019t you be more responsible?If you represent retail, why can\u2019t we see your books?If you represent retail, why is your PFOF system screwing us over?If you represent retail, why do you prevent genuine price discovery?If you represent retail, why use dark pools and use other methods to avoid lit exchanges?Was that you that has a hissy fit on Twitter, or one of your underlings?Where do your private jets keep going?Why do you hate cats?Now, I\u2019m just an idiot without any money, so obviously I\u2019m completely unimportant and I know you could answer ALL of these questions fully and to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, but I am confident this community could present some questions that will challenge you intellectually. Think you can handle it Ken? Or do you think some people here could outsmart you?So again, drop the lawyers, drop the facade, sack up, and come talk to the people you claim to represent.I double dog dare you. No backsies.If it makes you feel better, I promise I won\u2019t ask about the Lolita Express and related matters. (I do not speak for everyone however).Now I\u2019m flexible, so you can choose the date and time. I just need a picture of you on Twitter with a shoe on your head, for validation reasons. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t beneath your dignity.I patiently await your response.Regards,SLODt.P.S.I\u2019ll sweeten the deal by drawing your chosen username too.P.P.S.If I get reported to admin, I\u2019ll know it was you Ken.",

In this game, whenever an enemy takes damage, they automatically escalate to a more dangerous phase and retaliate appropriately. Sometimes, the final phase is actually an attempt to retreat.

    "text": "Lockheed Martin recorded a $555M loss inQ4 2024on a classified aeronautics program.Lockheed described the impacted aeronautics program as a fixed-price incentive fee contract involving\u201chighly complex design and systems integration.\u201dThe company conducted a review of the program due to undisclosed near-term milestones and trends experienced in the fourth quarter, and recorded losses based on \u201chigher projected costs in engineering and integration activities that are necessary to achieve those forthcoming milestones,\u201d it said.Lockheed just yesterday reported another $950M loss fromQ2 2025, also from aclassified aeronautics program, a Skunkworks project to \u201cpush the boundaries of science and technology to deliver highly advanced solutions that provide our customers a step-function advantage over potential adversaries.\u201d\u201cThis is a highly classified program that can only be described as a game-changing capability for our joint U.S. and international customers,\u201dTaiclet added, \u201cand therefore it is critical that it be successfully fielded.\u201dThe$150B defense reconcilliation billincluded $1.1B for \"strike aircraft\"$9 billion for air superiority. The latest version of the bill deleted $1 billion in spending for classified programs and inserted $600 million for an Air Force long range strike aircraft and $500 million for a Navy long range strike aircraft \u2014 two efforts that do not seem to be associated with a publicly-known program of record.From thebill:18) $600,000,000 for the development, procurement, andintegration of Air Force long-range strike aircraft; and (19) $500,000,000 for the development, procurement, and integration of Navy long-range strike aircraft.All of the above are facts. Their connection is speculation. The \"long-range strike aircraft\" could be completely unrelated to Lockheed's losses. Personally, I think this is likely the case, as Lockheed does not have much of a history of building strike aircraft for the Navy.But the two large aeronautics losses for Lockheed may very well be connected. Who knows. But if it is a single program, this is a significant program, as shown by the $1.5B loss recorded in the past 3 quarters.Lockheed recorded these losses because they\"discovered new insights in the quarter that required us to adjust our expected future costs on that program and then recognized the charge for doing so.\"Their accounting process recorded the loss immediately. A program with a $1.5B \"oopsie we underestimated the costs\" is a program with significant revenue potential.For comparison, Northrop Grumman recently recorded a$477M losson the B-21 Raider program in order to increase the production rate (perhaps doubling it from 7 to 14 aircraft per year). This is on a program that will likely earn Northrop over $100B in revenue.Worth noting that Lockheed Martin is a very large defense prime that does many many things. No, it's not \"definitely\" SR-72.",

    "text": "I am not OP. That isu/ThrowRA-chroniclywho posted tor/relationship_adviceTW:infidelity, weaponized incompetence, gaslightingOriginal PostJune 14th, 2025My husband I have been together for 8 years, the last 3 we\u2019ve been married. Little things keep adding up and I don\u2019t even know how to approach these issues. He wants kids soon but I can\u2019t trust that he\u2019d support me. I\u2019m trying to figure out if I try to work on us or just leave.Recently as in the last 4 years, I have been dealing with chronic health issues but just this year alone I\u2019ve had 3 surgeries to fix various things for my health. Our sex life hasn\u2019t been good in a few years since I got ill. Maybe once or twice a month, he has told me that it\u2019s not enough and he\u2019s feeling rejected and is making his mental health worse but if we have kids we won\u2019t be able to have sex while I\u2019m recovering?I work 5-6 days a week 12 hour night shifts in healthcare. I am the primary breadwinner in our relationship, he bounces from job to job and recently was unemployed for over a year while he was claiming to be applying to jobs. I know the job market is horrible right now so I wasn\u2019t pushing. I found out he was lying, he hadn\u2019t applied for anything in about 6 months including the jobs I got him recommended for through some connections I have. We got into a massive fight and I basically told him if he didn\u2019t have a job at the end of the month I was leaving and he could figure out bills himself. Not even a week later he was back working at his old job.I still do all the cooking, cleaning, and household upkeep. On my days off I spend 3-4 hours just putting everything in order for the week. Even when he wasn\u2019t working he wasn\u2019t doing anything except playing video games in another room while I slept, so when I\u2019d wake up there would be laundry I\u2019d have to switch or cat litter I\u2019d have to scoop.He wants kids soon, but with my chronic health problems it\u2019s going to make children a really hard process on my body, lots of health risks and I would basically have to be on bed rest the whole time and in and out of doctor appointments. I couldn\u2019t work or do anything really and I\u2019m just scared I won\u2019t get the support that I need. I don\u2019t even know if I want to have kids with him anymore.He gets money every month from a settlement and he says it\u2019s enough to make up for the income I won\u2019t be bringing in if I get pregnant. The settlement payout every month is less than  1/4 of what I make in 2 weeks.I feel like I\u2019m his mother already, I feel like I\u2019d be one of those married single mothers\u2026.I\u2019ve asked him about therapy, individual or couples and he is dismissive. Saying therapy hasn\u2019t helped in the past. So I\u2019ve asked about medications but he doesn\u2019t want to take a pill everyday.I don\u2019t want to come across as horrible or manipulative but I\u2019m about ready to write out everything I do, bill payments, chores, time I\u2019m at work, etc. and have him do it all for a month then tell me he thinks we can have kids right now.Edit (6/14 @2300):A few things since this is a real story and not AI. And I am a real person who is making choices in order to keep up with the current economy and situation-1)I work the hours I do so I can build up my PTO and sick time for my procedures and recovery time. Yes I have FMLA for these but it only pays out 60% of my wage vs 100% if I use PTO. Overtime accrues PTOx2 and pays time and a half, we also have a pick up bonus of $10 an hour. I have been working at this hospital since 2015 as a CNA and phlebotomist since 2018 and an RN since 2020 so I have seniority and that comes benefits, Yay unions!2)I work night shift because it has the flexibility for my schedule and they work with me for my restrictions. I am lucky enough to work in a hospital that uses lifts and is staffed as well as can be currently. Shift differential also gives me an additional $6 an hour and that quickly adds up.3) My surgeries were laparoscopic, and recovery time is about 1-4 weeks on average. Surgery 1 and 3 were both exploratory. My second was to remove a lesion on my intestines that connected them to my abdominal wall as well as a cyst on my ovary, and recovery was 4 weeks with 4 more on restrictions. I am about to have a 4th surgery to remove my gallbladder, recovery is 1-2 weeks with 2 weeks of recovery. Yes I have had a lot of surgeries this year but I haven\u2019t had any before this unless you count upper and lower GI scopes, pelvic floor testing, gastric emptying test, X-rays, CTs, an MRI, labs, genetic testing, and HIDA scans. Or maybe the diet changes and medications that you have to be on for months at a time before you\u2019d see any really changes. I also have the birth control implant and me coming off of that would involve about 3 different doctors\u2019 inputs and oversight.4) I blocked all of my husbands accounts and his friends accounts that I know of. I plan on deleting this at some point, but I\u2019ve just gotten angrier with each comment and everything I type out. At this point I don\u2019t care if he finds this. Maybe it would be a wake up call he needs.5)Our wedding was supposed to take place in November of 2020. That obviously didn\u2019t happen. We rescheduled to the end of 2021 so we didn\u2019t loose deposits. He quit his job about 2 months after our wedding.6)People do things like meal prep for a week and find relaxation in cooking. My hospital provides scrubs. When I am home I have more than 6 pairs of underwear. So it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t have clothes if I don\u2019t do laundry every day.I appreciate all the comments but to the rude ones especially please remember that I am a real person. I\u2019m sorry I have to justify every small detail of my health problems for you. Unfortunately the knee brace girl in middle school sometimes grows up and still has health problems. :)This is my first time being alive and not everything is going to be perfect. I am trying my best and sometimes people do stupid things because they love someone.UpdateJuly 16th, 2025Hello again Reddit, my previous post is on my page. I tried to link it but the pain medication might be impairing me.I had my surgery a few days ago and since I have time off I figured I\u2019d write an update for anyone curious. It will be long and I apologize.TLDR: I tried to have one more discussion with him before I threw in the towel. He asked for an open marriage and I told him to move out. Papers are being filed and I have lawyer.I talked with my lawyer last week and the hope is papers are to be drafted and he will be formally served when he comes back from his work trip in 2 weeks.On one of my days off I wanted to have a discussion about our relationship and it didn\u2019t go well. I had spent the night cleaning and getting the house put together because my anxiety was so bad. When he woke up in the morning I had breakfast made and we made just made polite small talk.I started the conversation by asking him if he was happy in our relationship, I\u2019ll summarize the conversation:Me: are you happy like this? With us? I feel like we are roommates more than a married couple..Him: I don\u2019t think either of us have been happy for a while\u2026 I do still love you and what to raise children with you, you\u2019ll be a great mom\u2026 I have been meaning to talk to you about somethingMe: \u2026okay\u2026Him: do you remember my friends in (city)? And how they were having problems in their relationship after (fake name) came out as ace? How they opened their relationship so (fake name) could still get his\u2026 needs\u2026 met. (At this point I was just staring at him, he kept rambling on) I\u2019ve joined some groups online, they said it saved their marriage. And with how much I\u2019m traveling now for work. It would be every other 2 weeks, you know. And I\u2019m in (city name) so it\u2019s not like it would be someone you know or would ever meet\u2026Me: what the fuck?Him: I mean think about it, we could have a surrogate this way. I know it would be a lot but we could make it work. You\u2019ve always talked about fostering or adopting and it would be just like that.Me: did you get someone pregnant? Is this your way of telling me you cheat on me when you travel for work?Him: no no no, god no, there was one girl at the bar who was flirting with me and it just felt nice to be wanted like that.He then pulled out his phone and started showing me \u201csupport\u201d groups he had joined online for poly people in monogamous relationships. There was probably 3 or 4 of them that he had been texting in for the last few weeks trying to gain the confidence to talk to me about opening up our relationship. He brought up how he knows I\u2019ve been thinking about switching to travel contracts and I can meet people there but then we come back home we\u2019re together and married because we still love each other.I have nothing against people who are in poly relationships, we have friends who are and have met their partners and go out all together. It\u2019s just not for me, when I\u2019m with someone I want to be the only person they\u2019re with. I don\u2019t want to get tested regularly, I don\u2019t want to risk surprise pregnancy, I don\u2019t want to feel jealous or wonder if he\u2019s texting another girl while he\u2019s supposed to be spending time with me.I let him finish his speech before I told him it hasn\u2019t felt like we\u2019ve been married in a long time and I\u2019m done. Hearing that he wants to see other people killed any last feelings I may have had. I\u2019m not in love anymore and staying together isn\u2019t going to make either of us happy. We both want kids but our timelines are different, what we want from the future is different now. I asked him to move out and he didn\u2019t seem surprised. I walked away and left him in the kitchen before I drove to my friend\u2019s house since I just couldn\u2019t be there. We spent the day drinking and eating ice cream while I went from crying to laughing to screaming.She is currently going through a divorce over her ex husbands porn addiction and the debt he put them in because of it. She gave me her lawyers information and I had an appointment set up with him a few days later.I went home the next day and he had moved most of his stuff out, his side of the closet is empty, his cat, the stuff in the bathroom, a few of our wedding pictures have been taken off the wall and I can\u2019t find them so I think he took them, and his gaming set up.The house feels incredibly empty now. He travels for work so I\u2019m used to being in the house alone but now my toothbrush is lonely in the cup on the sink. Our garage feels bigger now, the bed get cold, I only have to cook for one now. I miss his presence, I miss having someone to come home too, and I won\u2019t lie I\u2019ve spent the last week crying and my heart hurts.We didn\u2019t speak for a few days after he left, his mom reached out before he did. She wanted to see how I was doing and if there was anything she could do for me. We had a great relationship and I\u2019m honestly going to miss having her in my life. We have a lot of the same dietary restrictions but for different reasons, and she was my food adventure buddy. We would go out for a coffee or lunch to some of the few restaurants and cafes that we can safely eat at. She invited me out for coffee and I went. When we met up the next day we made small talk until the divorce came up.She let me know how he was doing, he moved into one of the houses on their property, they have like 60 acres and 4 houses on the property that different family members live in. He hasn\u2019t really gotten out of bed, she\u2019s worried about him and wanted us to talk it out. She asked if I was willing to go to couples counseling and told her I\u2019ve been asking for that for about a year and his response was no. I was drowning and he didn\u2019t want to help fix it but now that I\u2019ve decided to leave is when he wants to work it and I just can\u2019t. She stayed silent for a while before asking me if I still loved him, I do but I don\u2019t. I told her I loved who he was but I\u2019m too full of hurt that I don\u2019t feel the love anymore. I can\u2019t keep taking care of him like he\u2019s my child, I can\u2019t keep bank rolling our lives alone, I need a partner who is able to support me and I haven\u2019t felt supported by her son in a long time. We were both crying by the end of our talk and she gave a really big hug before leaving.He wanted to talk the next day and he came back to the house to talk. When he came in it was awkward, he wanted to give me a hug when he and I did, he went for a kiss and I turned my head so he kissed my cheek. We talked for a while about our relationship and how it got to this point. He apologized for a lot, he went into specifics of how he never helped around the house, he could\u2019ve done more since he was home. It wasn\u2019t fair to me that he put it all on me. He told me he\u2019s looking at a new job, one where he doesn\u2019t have to travel and it\u2019s actually in the field he got his degree in. He gave me an update on his cat, who is struggling to the adjustment of the new house. I told him I\u2019ll have papers for him in a few weeks and he couldn\u2019t look me in the eyes for the rest of the time he was there. I helped him pack some of the odds and ends that he left around the house and he left again.At the appointment with the lawyer we talked about what it would look like for the divorce process. Unless he wants the house I plan to buy his half. If I do that then there\u2019s a good chance I won\u2019t have to pay alimony unless he fights for it. He has the potential to make more than me so my lawyer doesn\u2019t think I\u2019ll have to pay anyways. We don\u2019t have children, unless you count fur babies, and I took a pregnancy test recently to confirm that I\u2019m not pregnant so that won\u2019t be a factor. We each own our cars and pay for them ourselves. We have a joint savings but I can prove I\u2019ve been the only one contributing for the last 2 years so it\u2019s likely I\u2019ll get most of that. I\u2019m not touching it besides for the bills for the house per my lawyers advice. I will hopefully have papers for my soon to be ex to fill out and if he gets a lawyer to look over.My 2 cats have been laying in bed with me and haven\u2019t left my side since he left. They\u2019re trying to make me feel better but it\u2019s hard. My friend who is also getting a divorce has said that we\u2019ll have a hot girl summer together and it makes me laugh but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready or even close to it. I don\u2019t want to meet new people I don\u2019t want to do first dates again. I think I\u2019m just going to single for a while.My mom sent me me this poem after I told them about the divorce and it makes me cry reading it, I\u2019ve learned a lot from this relationship and I\u2019m content being the old crazy cat lady for the foreseeable future.\u201cI will never love the same after you. I was always the girl that loved so hard that it hurt, until it hurt. I watched you change everyday until you eventually become someone I told myself I would never settle for. But how do I leave you? I told myself it was just a rough patch and we can work through this. I will do more to make you love me again. Because I don\u2019t give up on people. So why would I do that to you? I will put myself through hell for you, I will hate myself to love you, and I will rip myself apart so that you feel cared for. Because I was serious when I said I would die for you, because I almost did\u2026 I guess I ripped myself apart so much that I had nothing left. I cared so much about you that I stopped caring about myself completely. I lost who I was and I was no longer strong. And I watched myself change everyday until I eventually became someone I told myself I\u2019d never be. But it\u2019s my fault for not having a limit on how much I\u2019m willing to give, And for how long I\u2019m willing to stay. And for loving you more than I loved me. Because I loved you so hard that it hurt\u2026 So I will never love the same after you\u201d-\u201cI will never love the same after you\u201d  by Allie HardingThanks Reddit for support and validating my feelings, I don\u2019t know yet if I\u2019m going to delete this or not. But I don\u2019t think I will update this or ever long into this account again. I hope everyone stays happy and healthy :) take care.I am not the original poster.

I have questions, such as;How can you own a hedge fund and a market making business? Is that not a massive conflict of interest?Why did you lie to Congress?Did you really puke in front of congress?How did you manage to be in possession of a ton of Puts right before the buy button was removed on that fateful day?What is your real relationship with mayonnaise?Why do you think buying \u2018meme\u2019 stocks puts pension funds at risk? Are you not responsible if thats the case?How much do you pay your shills?Has Vlad finally been able to reach you? Or have you blocked his number?Just how much are you underwater financially?Was it really necessary to buy a copy of the constitution? Shouldn\u2019t you be more responsible?If you represent retail, why can\u2019t we see your books?If you represent retail, why is your PFOF system screwing us over?If you represent retail, why do you prevent genuine price discovery?If you represent retail, why use dark pools and use other methods to avoid lit exchanges?Was that you that has a hissy fit on Twitter, or one of your underlings?Where do your private jets keep going?Why do you hate cats?Now, I\u2019m just an idiot without any money, so obviously I\u2019m completely unimportant and I know you could answer ALL of these questions fully and to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, but I am confident this community could present some questions that will challenge you intellectually. Think you can handle it Ken? Or do you think some people here could outsmart you?So again, drop the lawyers, drop the facade, sack up, and come talk to the people you claim to represent.I double dog dare you. No backsies.If it makes you feel better, I promise I won\u2019t ask about the Lolita Express and related matters. (I do not speak for everyone however).Now I\u2019m flexible, so you can choose the date and time. I just need a picture of you on Twitter with a shoe on your head, for validation reasons. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t beneath your dignity.I patiently await your response.Regards,SLODt.P.S.I\u2019ll sweeten the deal by drawing your chosen username too.P.P.S.If I get reported to admin, I\u2019ll know it was you Ken.",

So here is the Dungeon World 2 alpha playtest:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Hp3f8laeI1bf-pRrwD9nXqkRxZAbB_PNI find enemies' escalation mechanic very fascinating. In this game, whenever an enemy takes damage, they automatically escalate to a more dangerous phase and retaliate appropriately. Sometimes, the final phase is actually an attempt to retreat. For example, a dragon's escalation track looks like this:\u2022 Annoyed \u2014Tear something to pieces\u2022 Proud \u2014Take to the skies\u2022 Nervous \u2014Conjure allies of living flame\u2022 Furious \u2014Ignite everything in the scene\u2022 Afraid \u2014Escape to enact future vengeanceA masked thief's is like this:\u2022 Endangered \u2014Unleash dangerous poison\u2022 Cornered \u2014Escape with shadows and smokeAn elven queen's is like this:\u2022 Angry \u2014drown the invaders under the burgeoning green\u2022 Hurt \u2014unleash the blight, consequences be damned\u2022 Hopeless \u2014slow down forest time to a crawlIn certain cases, an escalation track weakens an enemy, such as a horde with diminishing numbers.I have already talked about the new, diceless Defyhere,here, andhere.",

    "text": "Lockheed Martin recorded a $555M loss inQ4 2024on a classified aeronautics program.Lockheed described the impacted aeronautics program as a fixed-price incentive fee contract involving\u201chighly complex design and systems integration.\u201dThe company conducted a review of the program due to undisclosed near-term milestones and trends experienced in the fourth quarter, and recorded losses based on \u201chigher projected costs in engineering and integration activities that are necessary to achieve those forthcoming milestones,\u201d it said.Lockheed just yesterday reported another $950M loss fromQ2 2025, also from aclassified aeronautics program, a Skunkworks project to \u201cpush the boundaries of science and technology to deliver highly advanced solutions that provide our customers a step-function advantage over potential adversaries.\u201d\u201cThis is a highly classified program that can only be described as a game-changing capability for our joint U.S. and international customers,\u201dTaiclet added, \u201cand therefore it is critical that it be successfully fielded.\u201dThe$150B defense reconcilliation billincluded $1.1B for \"strike aircraft\"$9 billion for air superiority. The latest version of the bill deleted $1 billion in spending for classified programs and inserted $600 million for an Air Force long range strike aircraft and $500 million for a Navy long range strike aircraft \u2014 two efforts that do not seem to be associated with a publicly-known program of record.From thebill:18) $600,000,000 for the development, procurement, andintegration of Air Force long-range strike aircraft; and (19) $500,000,000 for the development, procurement, and integration of Navy long-range strike aircraft.All of the above are facts. Their connection is speculation. The \"long-range strike aircraft\" could be completely unrelated to Lockheed's losses. Personally, I think this is likely the case, as Lockheed does not have much of a history of building strike aircraft for the Navy.But the two large aeronautics losses for Lockheed may very well be connected. Who knows. But if it is a single program, this is a significant program, as shown by the $1.5B loss recorded in the past 3 quarters.Lockheed recorded these losses because they\"discovered new insights in the quarter that required us to adjust our expected future costs on that program and then recognized the charge for doing so.\"Their accounting process recorded the loss immediately. A program with a $1.5B \"oopsie we underestimated the costs\" is a program with significant revenue potential.For comparison, Northrop Grumman recently recorded a$477M losson the B-21 Raider program in order to increase the production rate (perhaps doubling it from 7 to 14 aircraft per year). This is on a program that will likely earn Northrop over $100B in revenue.Worth noting that Lockheed Martin is a very large defense prime that does many many things. No, it's not \"definitely\" SR-72.",
